# Desaglomera

This is a project created for the MegaHack v3 2020. This is a web application to control how many people can
enter in a shopping food court and avoid people breaking the social distance. We used Ruby on Rails v6 for the all
application.

There are three personas that can use this APP:

1) A customer that wants to eat in the shopping's food court. He can see all available times to eat and order
my food in the restaurants. This will reverse a table for me there. When my order is ready, the customer will receive
a cellphone message alerting him.
2) A waiter that works in one restaurant of the food court. He can access the restaurant panel with a code and there
manage all products of my establishment and mark the orders as completed, calling the customers.
3) The food court manager. He can manage the restaurants.
